1. There was only a 2 degree difference in the high temperatures between June and December(good for the ice cream)
2. There was only 4 degrees difference in the average temperature(good for year round surfing)
3. With only an 8 degree lower temperature in December, only a fairweather surfer would skip those days.
## Summary:
From the analysis, it would appear that Oahu, Hawaii would be an excellent choice to open a surf and ice cream shop, as the temperature is mild year round.

There are two ways to provide a deeper analysis:
1. Compare the preciptation to the tempurature to see if rain would have any impact
2. Analize additional months to provide a more thorough look at the temperature range.
